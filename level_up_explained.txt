Rather than having a level system, character randomly gain stats after battle
depending on which items are equipped:

Sword    - 8% ATT +1, 5% HP  +1 | 1% -1 MAG
Bow      - 8% AGI +1, 5% ATT +1 | 1% -1 DEF
Staff    - 8% MAG +1, 5% ATT +1 | 1% -1 AGI
Armor    - 8% HP  +1, 3% DEF +1 | 
Gauntlet - 3% DEF +1, 3% HP  +1 | 
Ring     - 3% for any stat +1   | 
Spell    - 8% MAG +1            | 1% -1 ATT, 1% -1 HP
Nothing  - 1% for any stat +1   |

Each stat has a maximum value which may not be exceeded, as indicated here:

HP  -  99
ATT - (99 base / 255 with equipment bonus)
DEF - (99 base / 255 with equipment bonus)
MAG - (99 base / 255 with equipment bonus)
AGI - (99 base / 255 with equipment bonus)

In other words, a stat may only reach 99. But after adding equipment, the bonus
from the equipment can still stack up to a value of 255. This includes temporary
bonuses in battle such as spells.
