Edmund
"The Shadow Lord...'Tis but a drifting shadow, cast over ash and cinder..."

"I care not to know your narrative, as I care not to look upon darkness.
We wield the fire of vengeance, and so shall this light extinguish the shadow!"

Shadow Lord
"This is your meager lot? Justice? Hmph."

"An eye for an eye leaves the world blind."

Maya
"You would pardon forgiveness for your sins now?!"

Shadow Lord
"I care not for your forgiveness..."

"Revenge is an inexorable cycle of reprisal provoking counter reprisal. You follow in the path of light, but ask yourselves--is justice not a sin in itself?"

Edmund
"Shut-up! Curse you! You will pay for your sins in Hell!"

Shadow Lord
"This is how you requite my mercy? Foolish cur."

Glenn
"Mercy? The charlatan speaks of mercy!"

Shadow Lord
"Ah, the coward of Ragnoth. I suppose you have come to atone for your cowardice, as well?"

Glenn
"My sins cannot be atoned for. I merely owe my life for Ragnoth."

Shadow Lord
"A martyr of self-pity, no less."

Maya
"Glenn..."

Edmund
"Enough of this repartee! You will answer for your sins with your own blood!"

Maya
(Gracious Sir Edmund... Has vengeance consumed you so?)

Maya
"We've endured many a loss, but is this truly the answer we seek?"

Edmund
"...Milady? What of the resistance?!"

(The Prince...)

Maya
"We mustn't succumb to the ways of darkness, as did the Shadow Lord. Do you not understand, Sir Edmund? The plight of our people cannot be forsaken for revenge."

"Vengeance is still an act of self."

Edmund
"..."

Glenn
"Vengeance is a thirst as insatiable as regret..."

Shadow Lord
"Then you accede, your journey is in vain."

Maya
"Surrender yourself to the Magistrate of Ragnoth, and you will not come to harm!"

Shadow Lord
"I see. You still wish to craft my doom..."

"And if I humbly resist?"

Maya
"Then in sound mind and judgment, I decree it is necessary to take you by force."

[Shadow Lord 2 battle ensues]

Shadow Lord
"Descendant of Arcania... you are all I seek."

"Why place your comrades... in harm's way?"

"Just surrender... to... me...."

Maya
"Your reign has ended, Shadow Lord."

Shadow Lord
"Hmph. So you have... bested me."

[Shadow Lord moves toward the orb]

Shadow Lord
"The battle may... be over..."

"...but not... the war!"

[screen shakes and flashes as Shadow Lord regains strength from the orb]

Edmund
"What is this?!"

Glenn
"The orb!"

Shadow Lord
"Fill me, heaven!"

"Ah, hah, hah, hah!"

Maya
"That relic! An outlet to the Arcanian realm?!"

[shaking stops, Shadow Lord floats above the platform]

Shadow Lord
"Maggots. Contemptible maggots."

"I shall pave my way to Arcania with your blood!"
