## Galandros: ##
  * Picked project! Uh, uh!
  * optimized by space keyget rotine, also preserves ix (tested)
  * optimized grayscale masks, way much less flicker on emulator now

### My to do: ###
  1. see all code
  1. Making JavaScript utility to convert normal text strings to custom font
  1. enter data (texts, items, etc.)
  1. code what remains
  1. Optimize things (but code and finish first, optimize later)
  * data for font set is repeated. (Dark Layer = Light Layer)
  * Optimize customfontC and FontSet (even Liazon noted)
  * mapper2.z80 --> labels "draw6x4map\_dark" and "draw6x4map\_light"
  * add constant multiply by 6. No need for DExA for this
