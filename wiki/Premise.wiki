 Long ago, in a vast land known as Gaia, there lived a great and righteous king by the name of Lord Grendale. He presided over the rich country-side of St. Agaea, sustaining peace with a swift and just hand. At his right side was his brother-in-arms, Sir Darius. Sir Darius had sworn an oath to protect his brother's kingdom and preserve his authority. And for many years, he was the most honored and revered knight in all the land... However, some would say that there was a jealous aura about Sir Darius. Though he was arguably mightier than Lord Grendale, he was but a servant to His Majesty.

 While scouting away from the kingdom one day, Darius encountered a powerful, half-draconic mage named Darsel. Quick to draw his sword and ready himself for combat, Darius soon found himself over-powered by one of the mage's spells. Rather than finish him off, however, Darsel expressed that he simply wanted to have a conversation with Darius. Weakened and at the mage's mercy, Darius had no option but to surrender his time to Darsel's words. In their talks, he teased him with rumors of a great relic lying in wait of mighty heroes such as himself. The relic is said to grant its wielder the power of dragons. Darius couldn't help but to wonder if he might harness such power to overthrow his brother and command his kingdom. At the same time, he was reluctant to listen to Darsel, given that there must be some conditions involved. Certainly, Darsel reassured him that he would not be left empty-handed for providing this information. In return, he requested that Darius become his apprentice, training himself under Darsel's tutelage. With some consideration, Darius infact decided to resign his duty and become the mage's apprentice.

 Although Lord Grendale was disappointed upon hearing word of Darius' betrayal, he was not determined to give up on his brother so quickly. Unfortunately, most of the soliders he deployed were slain before they could even reach Darius' stronghold. Let with no choice, he appointed his only remaining solider -- a young squire by the name of Fenris -- to fulfill the quest. However, it would not be a simple one. If Fenris was to have any hope of overthrowing Darius, he would need to borrow the very essence of the gods. Realizing this, he gathered a party with his adopted brother, Rowley, and the king's own daughter, Princess Annika. The three of them were prepared to challenge the great avatars of the gods, and ultimately, the ascended Fell Lord himself, Darius.
