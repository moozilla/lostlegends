== Galandros: ==
  * Picked project! Uh, uh!
  * optimized by space keyget rotine, also preserves ix (tested)
  * optimized grayscale masks, way much less flicker on emulator now

=== My to do: ===
  # see all code
  # Making JavaScript utility to convert normal text strings to custom font
  # enter data (texts, items, etc.)
  # code what remains
  # Optimize things (but code and finish first, optimize later)
  * data for font set is repeated. (Dark Layer = Light Layer)
  * Optimize customfontC and FontSet (even Liazon noted)
  * mapper2.z80 --> labels "draw6x4map_dark" and "draw6x4map_light"
  * add constant multiply by 6. No need for DExA for this

=== Personal Notes ===
  * routines to implement:
  * text script that supports word-wrapping and translations
