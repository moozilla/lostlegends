Notes on the font
=================

Problem:

As you know, the font does not follow the standard ASCII format, and it also can't. After looking at it I figured that I would just agree with Liazon. A solution is presented below.

Solution:

The font map includes many extended characters that are unique to this game. I will be writing a "compiler" to convert text written by a person in a .txt file into what it should equal for the Lost Legends font map. I will write this in C, and probably complete it this week. Improvements can be suggested to my approach in this document in this document, or Issues. Here is how I propose to solve this extended character map problem.

Standard characters that will be "compiled:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z ! ? (space) (period) : ' , - / * # +

Characters that will need to be special cased, and my proposed names(refer to font.gst for the characters; NN = Need Name):

40 - [elip]
44 - [right_quotation]
45 - [left_quotation]
46 - [left_quotation_period]
52 - LI
53 - IL
54 - LL
55 - [right_arrow]
56 - [left_arrow]
57 - [up_arrow]
58 - [up_double1]
59 - [up_double2]
60 - [heart]
61 - [sword]
62 - [staff]
63 - [bow_and_arrow]
64 - [book]
65 - [armor]
66 - [glove]
67 - [ring]
68 - [potion]
69 - [key]
70 - [poison]
71 - [seperator]
72 - [corner_pane_ul]
73 - [upper_pane]
74 - [corner_pane_ur]
75 - [side_pane_l]
76 - [side_pane_r]
77 - [corner_pane_bl]
78 - [lower_pane]
79 - [corner_pane_br]
80 - [status1]
81 - [status2]
82 - [status3]
83 - [status4]
84 - [equip1]
85 - [equip2]
86 - [equip3]
87 - [item1]
88 - [item2]
89 - [item3]
90 - [command1]
91 - [command2]
92 - [command3]
93 - [command4]
94 - [left_arrow_blend]
95 - [right_arrow_blend]

As you can see, I need a lot of name suggestions. Here is a mockup compilation:

He said, [right_quotation]Hi![left_quotation_period][elip]Bye.

compiles to:

.db 19,16,38,30,12,15,38,44,19,20,10,46,40,13,36,16

Grendel's note:
* characters 58, 59 and 72 - 93 are multi-byte characters. When assembled, they form characters longer than the standard 8 pixel width.
