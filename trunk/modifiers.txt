Fire and Cold are elemental modifiers added to weapons, abilities, etc. Some
enemies can be damaged by targetting an elemental weak spot. Accordingly, the
following sums up various states in which these modifiers can exist:

added to attack - effect is added to normal attack damage
vulnerable - no specific defense; normal effect
invulnerable - defense against effect; no damage
weakness - weak against effect; double damage

Poison and Sleep are status modifiers. They can exist in three states:

added to attack - effect is added to normal attack (does not effect damage)
vulnerable - no specific defense; normal effect (does not effect damage)
invulnerable - defense against effect; no effect (does not effect damage)

A note: all characters are considered "vulnerable" to all states by default.
Adding equipment changes this state.

A note about the "enemy types" in the equipment and beastiary files:

Enemies may be weak against certain weapons. For instance, swords are effective against "beast" types. The damage added to this attack always ignores defense. So, using a sword against a beast type which has more defense power than the attacker does attack power, the enemy will still sustain the bonus damage from the weapon. Example:

Character has 56 ATK and uses a sword against a beast enemy with 78 DEF. The enemy may sustain 8 - 16 damage instead of 1.
