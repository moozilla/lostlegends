Fire and Cold are elemental modifiers added to weapons, abilities, etc. Some
enemies can be damaged by targetting an elemental weak spot. Accordingly, the
following sums up various states in which these modifiers can exist:

added to attack - effect is added to normal attack damage
vulnerable - no specific defense; normal effect
invulnerable - defense against effect; no damage
weakness - weak against effect; damage x2

Poison and Sleep are status modifiers. They can exist in three states:

added to attack - effect is added to normal attack (does not effect damage)
vulnerable - no specific defense; normal effect (does not effect damage)
invulnerable - defense against effect; no effect (does not effect damage)

A note: all characters are considered "vulnerable" to all states by default.
Adding equipment changes this state.
